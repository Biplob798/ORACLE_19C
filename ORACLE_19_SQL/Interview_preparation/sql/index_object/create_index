-- Main Reason: To Make Queries Faster

-- An index is used to speed up data retrieval.

-- Without index → Oracle reads the whole table (Full Table Scan).
-- With index → Oracle directly finds the required rows.

SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 100;

-- If table has 10,000 rows → Oracle checks all 10,000 rows.

CREATE INDEX emp_id_idx
ON employees(employee_id);


-- Now Oracle finds employee 100 quickly using the index.

SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 100;




-- An index:
-- • Is a schema object
-- • Can be used by the Oracle Server to speed up the retrieval 
-- of rows by using a pointer
-- of rows by using a pointer
-- • Can reduce disk input/output (I/O) by using a rapid path 
-- access method to locate data quickly
-- • Is dependent on the table that it indexes
-- • Is used and maintained automatically by the Oracle Server




CREATE INDEX emp_last_name_idx
ON employees(last_name);



CREATE TABLE NEW_EMP
(employee_id NUMBER(6)
PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX
(CREATE INDEX emp id idx ON
p_ _
NEW_EMP(employee_id)),
first_name  VARCHAR2(20),
last_name   VARCHAR2(25));
