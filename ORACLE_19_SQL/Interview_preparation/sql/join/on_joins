The ON clause is the modern, explicit way to specify join conditions. Unlike USING, it allows you to join columns with different names and use table aliases for clarity.


SELECT e.emp_name, s.salary
FROM test_Employees e
JOIN test_Salary s 
ON (e.emp_id = s.id AND e.dept_name = s.dept);






SELECT e.employee_id, e.last_name, e.department_id,

d.department_id, d.location_id
FROM employees e JOIN departments d
ON (e.department_id = d.department_id);





SELECT e.employee_id, e.last_name, e.department_id,

d.department_id, d.location_id
FROM employees e JOIN departments d
ON (e.department_id = d.department_id)
AND e.manager_id = 149 ;


SELECT e.employee_id, e.last_name, e.department_id,

d.department_id, d.location_id
FROM employees e JOIN departments d
ON (e.department_id = d.department_id)
WHERE e.manager_id = 149 ;
