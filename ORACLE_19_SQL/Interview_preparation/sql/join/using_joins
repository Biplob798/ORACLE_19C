-- Creating Joins with the USING Clause
-- • If several columns have the same names but the data 
-- types do not match, use the USING clause to specify the 
-- columns for the equijoin.
-- • Use the USING clause to match only one column when 
-- more than one column matches

SELECT employee_id, last_name, 
location_id, department_id
FROM   employees JOIN departments
USING (department_id) ;




-- Using Table Aliases with the USING Clause
-- • Do not qualify a column that is used in the NATURAL join or 
-- a join with a USING clause.
-- • If the same column is used elsewhere in the SQL 
-- statement, do not alias it.



SELECT l.city, d.department_name 
FROM   
locations l JOIN departments d
USING (location_id)
WHERE d.location_id = 1400;



SELECT l.city, d.department_name
FROM   locations l JOIN departments d USING (location_id)
WHERE  location_id = 1400;

-- The USING clause is a cleaner way to perform an Equijoin when the column names are identical in both tables. It replaces the ON clause.



SELECT emp_name, dept_name, manager_name
FROM test_Employees
JOIN test_Departments USING (dept_name);






SELECT employee_id, last_name,
location_id, department_id
FROM employees JOIN departments
USING (department_id) ;



SELECT first_name, e.department_name, d.manager_id
FROM employees e JOIN departments d USING (department_id)
WHERE department_id = 50;
