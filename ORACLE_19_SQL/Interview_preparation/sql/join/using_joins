The USING clause is a cleaner way to perform an Equijoin when the column names are identical in both tables. It replaces the ON clause.



SELECT emp_name, dept_name, manager_name
FROM test_Employees
JOIN test_Departments USING (dept_name);






SELECT employee_id, last_name,
location_id, department_id
FROM employees JOIN departments
USING (department_id) ;



SELECT first_name, e.department_name, d.manager_id
FROM employees e JOIN departments d USING (department_id)
WHERE department_id = 50;
