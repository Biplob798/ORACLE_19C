A Nonequijoin is a join condition that does not use the equal sign. It uses operators like <, >, <=, >=, or BETWEEN. It is perfect for finding data within ranges.

To demonstrate this, let's find all employees who earn more than a specific flat rate (e.g., more than 1500).









SELECT e.emp_name, s.salary, s.dept
FROM test_Employees e
JOIN test_Salary s ON (e.emp_id = s.id)
WHERE s.salary > 1500;







SELECT e.last_name, e.salary, j.grade_level
FROM employees e JOIN job_grades j
ON e.salary

BETWEEN j.lowest_sal AND j.highest_sal;
