-- This is the most common join. It only returns rows where there is a match in both tables. We can use this to see the Salary for each employee by matching both id and dept.


SELECT e.emp_name, s.dept, s.salary
FROM test_Employees e
INNER JOIN test_Salary s 
ON e.emp_id = s.id AND e.dept_name = s.dept;




-- Result: Lists employees like 'Fahim' and 'Hassan' with their respective salaries.
