-- A Left Join returns all rows from the "left" table (Employees), even if they don't have a match in the "right" table (Salary).




SELECT e.emp_name, s.dept, s.salary
FROM test_Employees e
RIGHT OUTER JOIN test_Salary s
ON e.emp_id = s.id AND e.dept_name = s.dept;



-- Result: You will see 'Abir' even if he doesn't have a salary record yet (his salary will show as NULL).
