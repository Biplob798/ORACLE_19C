<!-- This subquery returns exactly one row and one column (a single value). Because it returns only one value, you use standard comparison operators like =, >, <, or <>.

When to use: When you need to compare a value against a specific metric, like an average or a specific person's salary.






Example: Find employees who earn more than the average salary. -->



SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);


<!-- Display the employees whose job ID is the same as that of employee 141: -->

SELECT last_name, job_id
FROM employees
WHERE job_id =

(SELECT job_id
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 141);






<!-- "Identify all employees who hold the same job title as 'Taylor' but earn a higher salary than 'Taylor'. Display their last names, job IDs, and salaries." -->







SELECT last_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE job_id =

(SELECT job_id
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Taylor')

AND salary >

(SELECT salary
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Taylor');


<!-- Using Group Functions in a Subquery -->

SELECT last_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary =

(SELECT MIN(salary)
FROM employees);
