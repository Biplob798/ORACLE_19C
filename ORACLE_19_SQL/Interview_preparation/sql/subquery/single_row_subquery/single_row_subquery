<!-- This subquery returns exactly one row and one column (a single value). Because it returns only one value, you use standard comparison operators like =, >, <, or <>.

When to use: When you need to compare a value against a specific metric, like an average or a specific person's salary.

Example: Find employees who earn more than the average salary. -->



SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
