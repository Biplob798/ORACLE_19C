-- When a subquery is in the FROM clause, it is often called an Inline View. You are basically creating a temporary table on the fly and then selecting from it.

-- Example: Treat the "post-Davies" group as its own table, then select only the last names from that specific set.

SELECT sub.last_name
FROM (SELECT last_name, hire_date 
      FROM employees 
      WHERE hire_date > (SELECT hire_date 
                         FROM employees 
                         WHERE last_name = 'Davies')) sub;
