<!-- This subquery returns multiple rows but only one column. Since it returns a list of values, you cannot use =, you must use operators like IN, ANY, or ALL.

When to use: When you want to filter results based on a dynamic list of IDs or categories.

Example: Find all employees who work in departments located in 'New York'. -->



SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id 
                        FROM departments 
                        WHERE location = 'New York');
