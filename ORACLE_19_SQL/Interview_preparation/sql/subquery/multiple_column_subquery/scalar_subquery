-- A Scalar Subquery is a subquery that returns exactly one value (one row and one column). You can use these almost anywhere, including the SELECT list.

-- Example: Show each employee's name alongside the total count of all employees in the company.



SELECT last_name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees) as total_staff
FROM employees;



-- Scalar subqueries in CASE expressions:



SELECT employee_id, last_name,

(CASE
WHEN department_id =
20

• Scalar subqueries in the SELECT statement:

(SELECT department_id
FROM departments
WHERE location_id = 1800)
THEN 'Canada' ELSE 'USA' END) location

FROM employees;



-- Scalar subqueries in the SELECT statement:



select department_id, department_name,
(select count(*)
from employees e
where e.department_id = d.department_id) as emp_count
from departments d;
