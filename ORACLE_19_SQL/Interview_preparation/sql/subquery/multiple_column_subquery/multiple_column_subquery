<!-- This is the "heavy lifter." It returns one or more rows and multiple columns. The outer query compares multiple columns at once against the results of the subquery.

When to use: When you need to match a "pair" or "set" of data (e.g., matching both the manager_id and department_id simultaneously).

Example: Find employees who have the same job and manager as 'John Doe'. -->








SELECT employee_name, job_id, manager_id
FROM employees
WHERE (job_id, manager_id) IN (SELECT job_id, manager_id 
                               FROM employees 
                               WHERE employee_name = 'John Doe');
