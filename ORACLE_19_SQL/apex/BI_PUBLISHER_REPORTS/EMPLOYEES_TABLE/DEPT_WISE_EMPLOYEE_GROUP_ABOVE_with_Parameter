-- step-1>
-- create a interactive report page with this sql query
SELECT d.department_number,
       d.department_name,
       e.employee_id,
       e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name employee_name,
       TO_CHAR(e.join_date, 'DD-Mon-RRRR') hire_date,
       TO_CHAR(e.salary, '99,99,999.99') salary
FROM   employees e,
       departments d
WHERE  e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER  BY d.department_number;

-- step-2>
-- now want to show my report in group above 
click action button>click control breaks>create a control break on department_number and department_name
-- step-3>
now we create a BI Publisherreport with same query
-- step-4>
SELECT d.department_number,
       d.department_name,
       e.employee_id,
       e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name employee_name,
       TO_CHAR(e.join_date, 'DD-Mon-RRRR') hire_date,
       TO_CHAR(e.salary, '99,99,999.99') salary
FROM   employees e,
       departments d
WHERE  e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER  BY d.department_number;
-- step-5>
after create xml file in report query 
now download the xml file and open in bi publisher desktop>
>department_wise_employee_group_above.xml
-- step-6>open this file in ms word and create a group on department_number and department_name like this 

department_wise_employee_group_above.docx
-- step-7> 
go to msword >load simple xml data >department_wise_employee_group_above.xml
-- step-8>
click table wizard>form>
step-9>
design the report as per your requirement and save it as department_wise_employee_group_above.rtf
-- step-10>
now upload this rtf file in bi publisher report created in step-3
-- step-11>         
-- now run the report by a button or link
-- after create its give a link to run the report
https://oracleapex.com/ords/r/supply_chain_management/supply-chain-management/f?p=&APP_ID.:54:&SESSION.:PRINT_REPORT=Department_Wise_Employee_Group_Above

or
we can print this report create by a Dynamic action

-- step-12>
create Dynamic Action on button click
execute javascript code
 code> javascript:window.open(
  'f?p=&APP_ID.:0:&SESSION.:PRINT_REPORT=Department_Wise_Employee_Group_Above',
  '_blank'
);
-- now run the page and click the button to see the report in new tab
-- step-13> 
-- now we can add a parameter to this report
create a region level page item P54_DEPT_NO for parameter
-- step-14>
region type select List >sql>SELECT DISTINCT
       d.department_name,
       d.department_number
FROM   employees e
JOIN   departments d
       ON e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER  BY d.department_name;
-- step-15>
now add this parameter in report query modify the query like below
SELECT d.department_number,
       d.department_name,
       e.employee_id,
       e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee_name,
       TO_CHAR(e.join_date, 'DD-Mon-RRRR') AS hire_date,
       TO_CHAR(e.salary, '99,99,999.99') AS salary
FROM   employees e
JOIN   departments d
       ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE  d.department_number LIKE NVL(:P54_DEPARTMENT_NUMBER, '%')--parameter 
ORDER  BY d.department_number;

-- step-16>
also add this query in report query >
now add this parameter in report query modify the query like below
SELECT d.department_number,
       d.department_name,
       e.employee_id,
       e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee_name,
       TO_CHAR(e.join_date, 'DD-Mon-RRRR') AS hire_date,
       TO_CHAR(e.salary, '99,99,999.99') AS salary
FROM   employees e
JOIN   departments d
       ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE  d.department_number LIKE NVL(:P54_DEPARTMENT_NUMBER, '%')--parameter 
ORDER  BY d.department_number;
-- step-17>
